# Archive Cleanup - October 7, 2025

## Files Archived

### Client Pages (1 file)

**1. Info.tsx â†’ archive/client/pages/Info.tsx.archived_20251007**
- **Reason**: Imported in App.tsx but no route defined
- **Status**: Never used in routing, only displays module overview
- **Impact**: None - page was inaccessible to users

## Changes Made

### App.tsx
- Removed unused import: `import Info from "@/pages/Info";`
- File cleaned up but all existing routes preserved

## Verification

All archived files have been:
- Moved to archive/ directory with timestamp
- Removed from import statements
- Verified not to break existing functionality

## Active Files Retained

All other identified files were retained because they are:
- **Dashboard.tsx**: Used in route (despite typo /dashbord)
- **PerformanceTest.tsx**: Dev tool, accessible via /performance-test route
- **All components**: Either used directly or part of component library

## Recommendation

### Route Typo to Fix
- Line 99 in App.tsx: `/dashbord` should be `/dashboard`

### Dev-Only Routes
Consider conditional rendering for development-only routes:
- `/performance-test`
- `/api-management`
- `/api-tests`

These should potentially be wrapped in `NODE_ENV==='development'` check.

##Statistics

- Files archived: 1
- Imports cleaned: 1
